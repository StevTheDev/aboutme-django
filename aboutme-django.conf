<VirtualHost *:80>
    # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
    # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
    # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
    # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
    # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
    # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
    # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
    #ServerName www.example.com

    # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,

    #LogLevel info ssl:warn

    # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are

    # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
