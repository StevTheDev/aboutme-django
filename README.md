# Hello!

This repository stores the code and configuration that I use to run the website at [stevthedev.com](https://stevthedev.com).

This Django project currently runs on an Ubuntu host using Apache and the Apache WSGI module using the default database setup. You can view the details of this setup in [AboutMe/config/](https://github.com/StevTheDev/AboutMe/tree/master/config).

I'm using Django to serve text posts and code snippets, as well as running a [Contact Page](https://stevthedev.com/contact). In [AboutMe/utilities/](https://github.com/StevTheDev/AboutMe/tree/master/config) you can see the basic utilites I created to format my content suitably for Django. 

Thanks for stopping by!
