# Hello!

This repository stores the code and configuration that I use to run the website at [stevthedev.com](https://stevthedev.com).

## This will be deployed as a set of services:
- **aboutme-djano:** a django web application
- **aboutme-data:** a postgresql database
- **aboutme-proxy:** a front end proxy server

I'm using Django to serve text posts and code snippets, as well as running a [Contact Page](https://stevthedev.com/contact). In [AboutMe/utilities/](https://github.com/StevTheDev/AboutMe/tree/master/config) you can see the basic utilites I created to format my content suitably for Django. 

Thanks for stopping by!
