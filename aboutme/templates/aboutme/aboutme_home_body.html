<h1>Hello Internet!</h1>
<p>I&#39;m an aspiring programmer! I have a few years of Computer Science education however with no degree. Those years were back in the first half of this decade, and since then I&#39;ve continued my education in a different direction. I have a couple certifications regarding computer networking and security principles and have spent the last couple of years working in the IT department of a medium-sized manufacturer. One of my last projects before leaving the company read from our system&#39;s database, cleaned and then reformatted our data into various output formats. This allowed us to quickly update our various selling platforms as our product lineup changed throughout the year. </p>
<p>I completed the project in python which I&#39;ve been allowed to share on my <a href='http://github.com/StevTheDev'>GitHub page here.</a> In completing this project I have developed a strong desire to work on a team whose primary focus is on software development. I believe my experience, which combines some work in a few different programming languages with a little bit of the configuration and administration of server and network devices, represent a useful set of skills in this field and I am looking for the opportunity to apply them.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d like to get in contact with me, please feel free to on either social media i guess or by using the <a href="{% url 'new_contact_submission' %}">contact form on this site.</a>Thanks for reading - have a good one!</p>
